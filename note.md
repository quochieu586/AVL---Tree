# Tree

## Basic Tree Concept

1.

- *Degree of a node*: the number of branches associated with the node.
- *In-degree branch*: directed branch toward the node.
- *Out-degree branch*: directed branch away from the node.

2.

- The first node is called the **root**.
- in-degree of the root = 0
- Except the root, the in-degree of a node = 1
- out-degree of a node = 0 or 1 or more.
